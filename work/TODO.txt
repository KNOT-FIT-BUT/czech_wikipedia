===> HIGH PRIORITY (missing functionality, bugs):


# DONE 1) do extraction with disambig removed
2) do phase 2 extraction on the new preprocessed dump
3) continue:

-- WikiExtractor removes Disambiguations (now fixed) and REDIRECTS
-- Math formulas expand into strings 'formula_XX' - ???
-- ? remove: Odkazy, Literatura, Externi odkazy, Souvisejici clanky, ...
-- ? remove empty sections


===> MEDIUM PRIORITY (completeness):

# DONE > spread fulltext fiiles into directories

# DONE > some titles begin with period or other dumb chars. This renders them hidden on Linux. Do some replacing in file naming in fulltexts/ directory


===> LOW PRIORITY (maybe in the future, not necessary):

> implement benchmark
> tweak logging and output of WikiExtractor.py
> add verbosity option
