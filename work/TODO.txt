===> HIGH PRIORITY (missing functionality, bugs):


1) do extraction with disambig removed
2) do phase 2 extraction on the new preprocessed dump
3) continue:

-- sentence matching fails at e.g. titles: "Mgr. Jaroslav" is split by the '.' as sentence !!!
-- WikiExtractor removes Disambiguations (now fixed) and REDIRECTS
-- Math formulas expand into strings 'formula_XX' - ???
-- remove: Odkazy, Literatura, Externi odkazy, Souvisejici clanky, ...
-- remove empty sections


===> MEDIUM PRIORITY (completeness):

> spread fulltext fiiles into directories

> some titles begin with period or other dumb chars. This renders them hidden on Linux. Do some replacing in file naming in fulltexts/ directory
> use better paragraph and sentence extraction patterns



===> LOW PRIORITY (maybe in the future, not necessary):

> implement benchmark
> tweak logging and output of WikiExtractor.py
> add verbosity option
