===> HIGH PRIORITY (missing functionality, bugs):


# DONE --> perform preprocessing (wikiextractor) with disambiguations removed
# DONE --> Use UDPipe REST API

--> Use local lib or exe UDPipe (REST API is ridiculously slow)

--> Remove articles "Seznamy *" (recognized by "[[Kategorie:Seznamy *]" at the end in wikidump)





- WikiExtractor removes Disambiguations (now fixed) and REDIRECTS
- Math formulas expand into strings 'formula_XX' - ???
- ? remove: Odkazy, Literatura, Externi odkazy, Souvisejici clanky, ...
- ? remove empty sections


===> MEDIUM PRIORITY (completeness):

# DONE > spread fulltext fiiles into directories

# DONE > some titles begin with period or other dumb chars. This renders them hidden on Linux. Do some replacing in file naming in fulltexts/ directory


===> LOW PRIORITY (maybe in the future, not necessary):

> implement benchmark
> tweak logging and output of WikiExtractor.py
> add verbosity option
