===> HIGH PRIORITY (missing functionality, bugs):

1) do extraction with disambig removed
2) do phase 2 extraction on the new preprocessed dump
3) continue:

-- WikiExtractor removes Disambiguations (now fixed) and REDIRECTS


> handle Disambiguations and Redirections
> see GMAIL for all mistakes and "glitches"
> remove empty sections (two headings right after each other, e.g. in Eugen Wuster)
> remove sections Odkazy, Reference, SlovnÃ­ky?

===> MEDIUM PRIORITY (completeness):

> some titles begin with period or other dumb chars. This renders them hidden on Linux. Do some replacing in file naming in fulltexts/ directory
> use better paragraph and sentence extraction patterns



===> LOW PRIORITY (maybe in the future, not necessary):

> implement benchmark
> tweak logging and output of WikiExtractor.py
> add verbosity option
