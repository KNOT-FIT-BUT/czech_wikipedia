!- use better paragraph and sentence extraction patterns
!- remove empty sections (two headings right after each other, e.g. in Eugen Wuster)
!- remove sections Odkazy, Reference, Slovn√≠ky?
!- some titles begin with period or other dumb chars. This renders them hidden on Linux. Do some replacing in file naming in fulltexts/ directory

- implement time measurements
- tweak logging and output of WikiExtractor.py
- add verbosity option to xfrune_extractor
